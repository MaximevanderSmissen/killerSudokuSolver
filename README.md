# Killer Sudoku Solver

Solver for Killer & Normal sudoku's a small C# console project for the AI course of my degree at Avans.
In this project, the classic sudoku puzzle, as well as the killer variant, is viewed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).
Using the basic steps needed to solve any other CSP, (killer-)sudoku puzzles can be solved in a very efficient way.

The solver contains multiple settings, for enabling or disabling certain heuristics or optimizations.
In this way, the impact of these optimizations and heuristics on the time needed to solve, can easily be measured.
